# ✨ Activity 2 – PDA Formal Languages

## ✨ Samuel Rendón Pabón

## ✨ Nicolás Reyes Cano

This project contains three **Python** implementations related to the topic of **Languages Formal and Pushdown Automata (PDA)** following the context free gammar G

S -> aSb |  ε

The original file was divided into **three independent programs**, one for each algorithm, in order to run and analyze them separately.

## 📦 Detailed instructions for running your implementation

**Open the terminal in macOS and put the next line**
```bash
python3 actividad2_algoritmo1.py
```
```bash
python3 actividad2_algoritmo2.py
```
```bash
python3 actividad2_algoritmo3.py
```
🚀 **These 3 lines will run each of the algorithms you want to use**

🚀 **After the program runs, you will see that the strings for each algorithm work and give results**

🚀 **For Windows you can insert the code in VScode and run it from there, you will also see that the strings for each algorithm work and will give results**

## 📂 Files  

### 1. `actividad2_algoritmo1.py`  
📘**Description:**  
Generate strings that belongs or not to the grammar language (at
least four strings, two rejected and two accepted strings).  

---

### 2. `actividad2_algoritmo2.py`  
📘**Description:**  
Implement a PDA M that recognizes strings generated by the
grammar G. 

---

### 3. `actividad2_algoritmo3.py`  
📘**Description:**  
Receive the accepted strings from Algorithm_2 and build one of
the trees in Lecture 24, Dexter Kozen page 169; in this case we chose the form of the first tree:
"Sentential forms in a leftmost derivation of 𝑥 in 𝐺"

## 📚 Conclusion  
This project helps understand how **Pushdown Automata (PDA)** are applied to the validation of **Context-Free Languages (CFLs)**.  
Splitting the code into three files makes it easier to clearly see the independent functionality of the process of creating the strings accepted or not by the language, determine whether or not to accept it, and creating a visual representation of it trough a tree.
